                    <h2 id="11">How ITEM Standard works</h2>
                    <p>ITEM is a new object standard on top of Ethereum. It synergizes the properties of the three most common interfaces—ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155—and is thus interoperable with all existing Ethereum applications. By taking advantage of the sophisticated engineering behind ERC1155s, ITEMs can be used as an ERC20, ERC721 or as an ERC1155 as required.</p>
                    <p>ITEMs don’t need centralized storage to save objectId info. NFT data is saved in a specific ERC20 token that can also work as a standalone one, and allow for the transfer of parts of an atomic object. The ERC20 implementation has a unique Token Id, and its supply is the entire supply of that Token Id.</p>
                    <p>EthItems are designed to be extendable. Every new Collection can be hosted by a specific wallet, or better yet by a Smart Contract that has the right to mint new Items. This allows all developers to build their own minting rules and create an entire decentralized application based on it in a totally reusable general-purpose way. This is because, for the first time, the application’s logic (e.g. for a videogame) is fully decoupled from the NFT implementation itself.</p>

                    <h2 id="12">Wrapped ITEMs vs Native ITEMs</h2>
                    <p>Native ITEMs are a Collection’s objects that, via their Extensions, can perform complex behaviors specified optionally in the Extension logic. These extra capabilities are up to the developers writing the Extension logic.</p>
                    <p>Wrapped ITEMs, on the other hand, retain all the capabilities of the default ITEM standard, but lose any extra ones while wrapped. For example, once wrapped, A DAO or DFO governance token cannot interact with the DAO or DFO (until unwrapped), but can still be traded like any ITEM using a gas-efficient method like BatchTransfer. </p>
                    <p>To be clear: Wrapped items CANNOT have Extensions.</p>
                </article> 
                <article class="DocSectionSingleContent">
                    <h2 id="13">Unique vs fungible ITEMs</h2>
                    <p>For the EthITEM standard, there are two different ways to handle tokens. The first is for tokens with a limited supply of one, the second for tokens with a limited supply of more than one. Let’s say you want to wrap an NFT with a supply of 1. How can we guarantee that the original NFT will still be accessible and function as a unique token, but not be inflated?</p>
                    <p>The solution is in the way a unique token is wrapped as an ITEM. Once you wrap it, you’ll be able to redeem its underlying assets entirely. ETHITEM stores information on how many of the generated ITEMs have been burnt to redeem the underlying assets. If someone rewraps the unique token, he will obtain the number of tokens burnt in the first place. </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/1-1.png">
                    <p>Let's break this down with an example.</p>
                    <p>Peach has a unique NFT with a supply of 1. > She wraps it, creating 1 ITEM, and adds it to a DEX pool by "selling" it. > Waluigi wants to redeem Peach's NFT. > He buys 51% (0.51) of the NFT’s supply. > He then unwraps it, burning 0.51 tokens and obtaining the original NFT. > Goku buys the original NFT from Waluigi. > If he re-wraps the NFT, Goku will only receive the 0.51 itemized tokens that Waluigi bought from the DEX pool supply.</p>
                    <p>This approach ensures that even unique NFTs can be wrapped and made fungible while still retaining their uniqueness if redeemed.</p>
                    <p>The above process happens whenever we are left with only 1 ITEM inside the wrapped collection or it is natively unique (see “Wrapped ITEMs vs Native ITEMs”).</p>
                    <p>Suppose we have the “FabulousUnicornCard” of a hypothetical card game, and that the supply inside the collection is greater than 1. To redeem the original (aka unwrap it by burning the item), or use it in the case of a native ITEM, you need 1 to do so until all but 1 of the supply is burnt, at which point the above rule of needing only 51% of the ITEM applies.</p>
                    <p>An analog behavior happens with respect to the “transfer” functionality. When you transfer 0.51 (or more) of a unique ITEM, the receiver will see 1. If you move 0.49 (or less), they’ll see 0.</p>

                    <p>Any ERC20 version of any ITEM (native or wrapped) can interact with dApps more easily if integrated with EIP712. For end-users, this means replacing the need for manual Approval before using the ERC20 ITEMs with a simple signing, the same used by UniSwap LPs.</p>

                    <p>In a Native collection, when a new Item is minted, the generated objectId value corresponds, after hexadecimal conversion, to the address of the ERC20 token created.</p> 
                    <pre class="prettyprint"> 
//The function to call in a Native EthItem Collection is 
//function mint(uint256 amount, string calldata tokenName, string calldata tokenSymbol, string calldata objectUri, bool editable) external returns(uint256 newObjectId, address interoperableInterfaceAddress);

//Let's suppose the call returns you the following values:

var objectId = "115229128895248074900976864697884278495202009447";
var interoperableInterfaceAddress = "0x142f0d872a9579c61098c783aed1c5f9404c6167"

//The HEX version of the objectId is EXACTLY the address of the created ERC20 Token

var builtAddress = web3.utils.toHex(objectId);

//-> will exactly return 0x142f0d872a9579c61098c783aed1c5f9404c6167, which is equal to the original interoperableInterfaceAddress value.

//Now let's retrieve back the objectId from the interoperableInterfaceAddress

//Convert in abi
var abiEncodedValue = web3.eth.abi.encodeParameter('address', interoperableInterfaceAddress);

//-> will generate the value "0x000000000000000000000000142f0d872a9579c61098c783aed1c5f9404c6167"

//Convert in uint256
var builtObjectId = web3.eth.abi.decodeParameter('uint256', abiEncodedValue);

                    <p>Developing applications on top of Ethereum is one of the biggest challenges in tech—for teams big and small—due to a lack of resources and limitations with the blockchain. The most difficult thing is building applications that are general-purpose and decentralized by design, which is to say unreliant on any sort of centralized decision-making.</p>
                    <p>By limiting dependence on third-party intermediaries, the ITEM architecture is designed to resolve these and other major issues facing dApps today.</p>
                </article>
                <article class="DocSectionSingleContent">
                    <h2 id="22">Token Tracking Solution</h2>
                    <p>One highly controversial and challenging problem in Ethereum development is the tracking of all existing tokens. It is impossible for a dApp to do this efficiently without relying on intermediary servers, forcing it to program its frontend—the most centralized and difficult to govern part—with echelons of hardcoded addresses. This puts it in the uncomfortable and untenable position of arbitrarily prioritizing some projects over others in order to improve their user experience.</p>
                    <p>To resolve this, the architecture for ITEMs (native and wrapped) is based on a general-purpose factory standard that generates all of the standardized methodology for every token.</p>
                    <p>This means that dApps only need to follow these steps:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">

var configuration = require("configuration.json");

//Get the Web3 engine
var Web3 = require('web3');

//Initialize your connection with a Ethereum node
var web3 = new Web3(configuration.web3URLConnectionString);

//Retrieve the last version of the EthItem Orchestrator Smart Contract
var ethItemOrchestrator = new web3.eth.Contract(configuration.ethItemOrchestratorABI, configuration.ethItemOrchestratorAddress);

//Prepare a var to collect all the ITEMs
var allCollections = [];
                    </pre>
                    <p>Phase 1) Retrieve all Wrapped ERC20 Collections directly by calling the Orchestrator. Each ERC20 Wrapped Collection is a Singleton, so there will always be just one active at a time, and its address is well-known. But the Orchestrator, of course, also collects all previous inactive versions (the last one is the currently active one).</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">

//Normalize the address for eventual search by address purposes
collectionAddress = web3.utils.toChecksumAddress(collectionAddress);

//Collection category to distinguish all collection types, "W20" means that this Collection is a Wrapper of ERC20 Tokens
var collectionCategory = "W20";

var collectionABI = configuration.W20ABI;

//The needed basic info to operate are of course the Collection address, category and Smart Contract. They can be of course enriched

}
                    </pre>
                    <p>Phase 2) Retrieve all the other Collections passing by their factories. There will always be just one active EthItem Factory at a time, but the Orchestrator, of course, also collects all previous, inactive versions (the last one is the currently active one).</p>

                    <p>Non-standard ERC implementations are a nightmare for dApp developers. The most popular example is USDT, valued at more than $17B. Just to be able to manage USDT, dApps are forced to hardcode their Smart Contracts with customized implementations.</p>
                    <p>ITEMs, however, all share the same standard methods. It is in fact impossible for them not to. Using ITEMs, dApp developers can finally work together on building amazing things without having to deal with broken ERC20s, non-standard interpretations of ERC1155, and so on…</p>
                    <p>The ITEM standard can also be upgraded via the ETHITEM DFO to new versions that incorporate new standards alongside the evolution of the Ethereum Ecosystem. But anytime the EthITEM DFO does upgrade the factory contract, this doesn’t automatically upgrade ITEMs of an older version. It enables ITEMs to upgrade themselves, and allows them to easily switch back and forth between old and new versions.</p>
                    <P>The Version model is a LEGO from one “Starter” Version, one Main Interface version and one Interoperable Interface version.</P>
                    <img src="assets/img/3-1.png">
                    <P>For “The Starter” there are 4 types: Native, Wrapped ERC20, Wrapped ERC721, Wrapped ERC1155. The Main Interface and the Interoperable Interface are just two separate types. Basically like this:</P>
                    <img src="assets/img/pokeexample-1.png">
                    <p>The versions are expressed in this simple way:</p>
                    <p><b>[Starter indicator_] - [Interoperable Interface Version] - [Main Interface Version] - [Starter Implementation]</b></p>
                    <p><b>Native ITEM:</b></p>
                    <p>Native_1.1.1 (Created by the Native Starter, Version 1, Main Interface Version 1 and Interoperable Interface Version 1)</p>
                    <p><b>ERC721 Wrapped:</b></p>
                    <p>W721_1.3.6 (Created by the Wrapper ERC721 Starter Version 6, Main Interface Version 1 and Interoperable Interface Version 3)</p>
                    <p><b>ERC1155 Wrapped:</b></p>
                    <p>W1155_2.4.9 (Created by the Wrapper ERC1155 Starter Version 9, Main Interface Version 2 and Interoperable Interface Version 4)</p>
                    <p><b>ERC20 Wrapped:</b></p>
                    <p>W20_1.1.1 (Created by the Wrapper ERC20 Starter Version 1, Main Interface Version 1 and Interoperable Interface Version 1)</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
//The version number of the EthItem Main Interface implemented by this Collection
var mainInterfaceVersion = await collection.contract.methods.mainInterfaceVersion().call();

//The version number of the EthItem Interoperable Interface model containing the code of every Item of this Collection;

//The address of the Collection created by the Factory

                    <p>Example: W721_1.5.3 means that the Collection is an ERC721 Wrapper one, based on the first version of the EthItem Token Standard Interface. All its Items implement the Interoperable Interface model v5 and it has been created following the ERC721Wrapper v3 Collection Model.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the event architecture, this structure helps dApps call specific ITEMs based not just on the type (native, wrapped) but also on the versions they trust.</p>
                    <p>For example, if v0.3 of the Main Interface has any bugs or functionalities that a dApp doesn't support, or which are in some way malicious, the dApp can just call items from all of the versions aside from this specific one.</p>

                <h2 id="28">Metadata Implementation</h2>
                <p>Metadata is a standard used in the ERC721 and ERC1155 ecosystems to express a token’s real information based on how creators manage the tokenUri link. In the ERC20 ecosystem, the most used info sources are the Etherscan servers and the Trust Wallet repo. Whenever you see a token logo on famous dApps, for example, you're trusting the Trust Wallet repo on GitHub.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: Token creators must pay Trust Wallet 1 BNB to add/edit their token logo/info.</p>
                <p>Using the ITEM standard, every token has a tokenUri with all of the official information needed to build a frontend without needing to deal with third parties. The most important benefit to security here is that the right to update the tokenURI of a token is with the owner. If the owner is a wallet, they fully control this info. If the owner is an on-chain org, or a smart contract with custom functionalities, the metadata can be upgraded directly via voting or other specific functions. No ITEM token owner has to rely on assumptions about third-party security.</p>

                    <p>At the core of the EthITEM system sits an Orchestrator, a contract that uses an external KnowledgeBase Contract to keep track of all native and wrapped tokens.</p>
                    <p>The first time a token gets wrapped, a Collection will be created. This will hold all future minted ITEMs by wrapping other instances of the same token.</p>
                    <p>The Orchestrator is an upgradable contract that uses a factory for the creation of the collections. The factory, in turn, relies on upgradable models, one for each of the wrappable standards. The models get cloned during the collection deployment (all collections are cloned from a Model).</p>
                    <p>Each model shares its version with its children Collections. Once it gets upgraded, a new Collection will be created when the first token is wrapped.</p>
                    <p>It’s easier to understand with an example:</p>
                    <p>Model: ERC721ModelV1 > Alice wraps an ENS. Since there’s no corresponding collection, a collection (ENSCollectionV1) is created by cloning the ERC721ModelV1. > Bob wraps an ENS. Since we already now have an ENSCollectionV1, that collection will be used (no new collection is created if there’s already one available). > The model is updated: ERC721ModelV2 > Julian wraps an ENS. Since the ENSCollectionV1 was cloned from an older model version, a new collection is created: ENSCollectionV2. All subsequent ENS that are wrapped will be inserted here. > Older collections can be migrated to newer ones, by unwrapping all their ITEMs and wrapping them with the new Models.</p>

                    <p>To wrap an ERC721, you need to use the safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external standard function, indicating the address of the Orchestrator as a token receiver.</p>
                    <p>One ITEM for each token. On the first wrapping, a collection is created by the Orchestrator. This collection implements the “function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);” standard function to receive other NFTs of the collection it wraps. This means that to wrap new ITEMs, you can save gas by bypassing the Orchestrator and sending the NFTs directly to the collection using the function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external; ERC721 standard method.</p>
                    <p>For each newly-wrapped NFT, a single ITEM will be added to the Collection and a new ERC20 will be minted, but the ERC20 objectId will always be the same. </p>
